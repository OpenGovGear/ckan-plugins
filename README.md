ckan-plugins
============

A collection of plugins for CKAN

Each plugin should serve a single purpose. Extract common code (such as general helpers) into a seperate plugin.

<h3>Reporting Issues:</h3>

When reporting issues make sure that you apply the proper labels. We want to be fixing bugs as soon and as quickly as possible. Ensure that the plugin is labeled for issue that you have reported. Make a label for the plugin if one has not been created.

Describe the problem in general terms and outline the 'what' that needs to be done. If possible recommend 'how' you think that the problem should be fixed or the feature implemented.

Whenever possible provide a screen shot of the issue and the conditions where the issue appears.

<h3>Pull Requests:</h3>

Make a seperate branch for each issue or related group of issues. Make a pull request when you are content with your solution. Your patch will be reviewed and discussed and then merged into the master branch.

Keep commit comments short but informative: "Fix button css", "Update form documentation", "Streamline license workflow", "Taste victory", "Conquer enemies".

If necessary add an extended description.

<h3>Coding Standards</h3>

All python code should follow the PEP 8 standards.

Refer to the CKAN docs for css, template, and javascript standards.
