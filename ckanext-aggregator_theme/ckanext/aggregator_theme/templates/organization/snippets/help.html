      <p>Contributors act like publishing departments for datasets (for
        example, the Department of Health). This means that datasets can be
        published by and belong to a department instead of an individual
        user.</p>
      <p>Within contributor, admins can assign roles and authorisation its
        members, giving individual users the right to publish datasets from
        that particular contributor (e.g. Office of National Statistics).</p>
